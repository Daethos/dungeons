# **[Dungeons & Dragons Homebrew][A First Place]**
<br />

## As one can surmise from the title alone, this app allows for you to utilize the landscape of Dungeons and Dragons and work your own creativity or otherwise into myriad layers of myth and magic. With D&D pulling threads of inspiration from around the world, this tool can aid in keeping personal changes and concepts applied to such foundational creatures as the **_Oni_**, to **Goblins**, **Orcs**, **Lamias**, **Kelpie**, to even _**Vampires**_ and _**Werewolves**_.

## At the opening of the app, you'll be prompted to login with Google credentials. It simply is going to share what is listed on the screen and nothing more, this is absolutely not photoshopped to misinform you in any way.

    <summary>Profile Creation</summary>

## From Here, we're asked to create a profile if we are not in possession. All that's needed is a name. Yep, that's just it. In the words of the Immortal Todd Howard, ['It just works.'][Todd!].

## Phew, made it to our profile. But no characters? Whomst would hope to defeat the Black Swordsman, or Prince Dorien? It's good I'm here to show you how to use this that I am selling to you now. What impeccable luck!

## And now we can settle on the matter of what you believe it is best to wear to a sudden and proper death in front of an adoring crowd, of course we are antiquitous in nature, and are not prone toward bothering to cheer for anyone but the proper favorites, of which you cannot hope to be--not yet, that is!

## Well look at you, I cannot attest for that cursed and maddening weapon you've chosen, but the beautiful attire you've selected to wear to battle is a sight to behold, it reminds me of our standard issue Licivitan equipment for soldiers, though the Daethic Knights tend to look a bit too Northren--yet I am a worldy man of course, and see no issue in such matters.

## Now that we can hope back into our profile and see with whom we've designed your next hail mary. And not a bad sort overall, but let's get a closer look real quick at this forsure champion.

# How to Survive Without Me
<br />

## This companion has quite a high ease of use, and a straightforward way to navigate between options of profile use, character creation, and viewing options, with an allowance to collect and hold different concepts to compare and contrast at your leisure.

    Charater Linking
    Profile Viewing
    Character Viewing
## With much of this being able to be performed on the navigation bar, and multiple options granting proper direction in what you're trying to aim for.
<br /><br />

## From smaller yet [higher reaching beginnings][whimsical] and a rough but shaping [framework in mind][trello], this will continue to become a deeper resource as redesign of P1 seeks to give this a higher purpose.

# Iceboxing
### * Dynamic tables granting built-in modifiers based on attack, damage, and defense type elemenets [SUCCESS]
### * Implement the viewing of special weapon, shield, and armor properties and have built-in calculators to test highest damage and defensive potentials. 
### * Once characters within game are more permanent, the ability to sync and update characters. [SUCCESS]
