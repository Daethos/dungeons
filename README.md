<br />

## As one can surmise from the title alone, this app allows for you to utilize the landscape of Dungeons and Dragons and work your own creativity or otherwise into myriad layers of myth and magic. With D&D pulling threads of inspiration from around the world, this tool can aid in keeping personal changes and concepts applied to such foundational creatures as the **_Oni_**, to **Goblins**, **Orcs**, **Lamias**, **Kelpie**, to even _**Vampires**_ and _**Werewolves**_.
